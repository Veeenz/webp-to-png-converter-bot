# Sticker to PNG Bot

This (mega) simple bot, @sticker_to_png_bot,  allows you to get PNG of any sticker keeping the transparency.

## But why?

Why? Every time I wanna edit a sticker and add to my pack I have to: Download the image, look for a webp converter, wait conversion, save and edit. And don't lie, at least one time you wanted to create a funny sticker just for make fun of friends.

### Run your local copy

Well, even if it's a small bot, I suggest you to start with a virtual environment (do it ever if you can)
```
python3 -m venv myenvironment
source myenvironment/bin/activate
```

### Installing

You can install modules with the dear pip :)
```
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install requests
pip3 install python-telegram-bot
```
